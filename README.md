**SwiftyOAuth** is a *small* OAuth library with a built-in set of providers and a nice API to add your owns.

```swift
let instagram: Provider = .Instagram(clientID: "***", redirectURL: "foo://callback")

instagram.authorize { result in
    print(result) // Success(Token(accessToken: "abc123"))
}
```

## Usage

#### Provider

[`Provider.swift`](https://github.com/delba/SwiftyOAuth/blob/master/Source/Provider.swift)

Initialize a provider with the custom URL scheme that you defined:

```swift
// Provider using the server-side (explicit) flow

let provider = Provider(
    clientID: "***",
    clientSecret: "***",
    authorizeURL: "https://example.com/authorize",
    tokenURL: "https://example.com/authorize/token",
    redirectURL: "foo://callback"
)

// Provider using the client-side (implicit) flow

let provider = Provider(
    clientID: "***",
    authorizeURL: "https://example.com/authorize",
    redirectURL: "foo://callback"
)
```

Alternatively, you can use one of the [built-in providers](https://github.com/delba/SwiftyOAuth#providers):

```swift
let github = .GitHub(
    clientID: "***",
    clientSecret: "***",
    redirectURL: "foo://callback"
)
```

Optionally set the `state` and `scope` properties:

```swift
github.state = "asdfjkl;" // An random string used to protect against CSRF attacks.
github.scopes = ["user", "repo"]
```

Define additional parameters for the authorization request or the token request with `additionalAuthRequestParams` and `additionalTokenRequestParams` respectively:

```swift
github.additionalAuthRequestParams["allow_signup"] = "false"
```

Handle the incoming requests in your `AppDelegate`:

```swift
func application(app: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, options: [String : AnyObject]) -> Bool {
    github.handleURL(url, options: options)

    return true
}
```

Finally, ask for authorization. SwiftyOAuth will either present a `SFSafariViewController` (iOS 9) or open mobile safari.

```swift
github.authorize { (result: Result<Token, Error>) -> Void in
    switch result {
    case .Success(let token):
        print(token)
    case .Failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

If the provider provides an expirable token, you may want to refresh it.

```swift
let uber: Provider = .Uber(
    clientID: "***",
    clientSecret: "***",
    redirectURL: "foo://callback/uber"
)

// uber.token!.isExpired => true

uber.refreshToken { result in
    // print("Token:", result.value)
}
```

#### Token

[`Token.swift`](https://github.com/delba/SwiftyOAuth/blob/master/Source/Token.swift)

The `access_token`, `token_type`, `scopes`, and informations related to the expiration are available as `Token` properties:

```swift
token.accessToken // abc123
token.tokenType // .Bearer
token.scopes // [user, repo]

token.expiresIn
token.isExpired
token.isValid
```

Additionally, you can access all the token data via the `dictionary` property:

```swift
token.dictionary // ["access_token": "abc123, "token_type": "bearer", "scope": "user repo"]
```

#### Error

[`Error.swift`](https://github.com/delba/SwiftyOAuth/blob/master/Source/Error.swift)

**Error** is a enum that conforms to the `ErrorType` protocol.

- `Cancel` The user cancelled the authorization process by closing the web browser window.

- `ApplicationSuspended` The OAuth application you set up has been suspended.

- `RedirectURIMismatch` The provided `redirectURL` that doesn't match what you've registered with your application.

- `AccessDenied` The user rejects access to your application.

- `InvalidClient` The `clientID` and or `clientSecret` you passed are incorrect.

- `InvalidGrant` The verification code you passed is incorrect, expired, or doesn't match what you received in the first request for authorization.

- `Other` The application emitted a response in the form of `{"error": "xxx", "error_description": "yyy"}` but SwiftyOAuth doesn't have a enum for it. The data is available in the associated values.

- `Unknown` The application emitted a response that is neither in the form of a success one (`{"access_token": "xxx"...}`) nor in the form of a failure one (`{"error": "xxx"...}`). The data is available in the associated value.

- `NSError` An error triggered when making network requests or parsing JSON. The data is available in the associated value.
